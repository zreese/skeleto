About
====

Skeleto is a WordPress theme to aide the data entry process when designing websites. It contains as few styles as possible. Using this theme when populating posts and pages will allow designers and content creators to see how their content looks at its most basic form. If content is digestible as pure markup you can implement an accessibility baseline: if the CSS fails to load, if the Javascript gets blocked, if the data connection drops in the middle of loading... your user will still be able to use the site.
